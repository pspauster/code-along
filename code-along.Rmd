Hi! Welcome to your first R Markdown. Here you can write text and add code to specific snippets, running them each individually.

Let's start by running our setup to get our libraries
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Let's come up with a research question!

I was standing on the subway platform recently, waiting for a delayed train and wondering if subway service has already gotten worse after the cancellation of congestion pricing earlier this year, which would have helped pay for repairs and upgrades.

So I'm going to go look and see what data there is on MTA service reliability!

I found this [MTA dashboard](https://metrics.mta.info/?subway/operationalmetrics)

And noticed this dataset on [on-time performance](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Terminal-On-Time-Performance-Beginning-/vtvh-gimj/about_data) is on the state open data site

Let's grab that data for the past two years!

```{r}
# Define the API endpoint and query parameters
url <- "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/92iy-9c3n.csv"
query <- paste0(url, "?$limit=1000000")

# Read the CSV file with the specified limit
storefronts <- read_csv(query)

```

This is a huge dataset! It would be really difficult to work with in QGIS. Let's use R to summarize some information we can map.

Let's start by cleaning the data a little bit.
- Get only the data from last year (2023). 2024 is not over yet
- Reformat the borough_block_lot as a character column
```{r}

#write your code here
storefronts_clean <- storefronts %>%
  filter(reporting_year == 2023) %>% 
  mutate(borough_block_lot = as.character(borough_block_lot))

```

Let's do some exploratory data analysis.

I wonder where all these properties are located? Should we try mapping it?

Here I'll help you out using the spatial features package to make the dataset into a spatial object

```{r}

storefronts_sf <- storefronts_clean %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"))

```

Now let's try mapping it. We can do this with our old friend ggplot!

```{r}

storefronts_sf %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_sf(mapping = aes())

```

That's a few too many points to look at.

Now let's take that dataset and create a new object where we summarize the vacancy rate by community board.

```{r}

#write your code here

storefronts_cb_sum <- storefronts_clean %>%  

```
